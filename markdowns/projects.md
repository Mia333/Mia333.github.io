- **Conditional VAE in Human-Robot Interaction** 

Deep Learning for robot motion planning in human-robot interaction (HRI). We propose a real-time probabilistic model using LSTM-based conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) for structured robot control policy learning and inference.

- **Car racing game playing**

Apply Deep Reinforcement Learning (DDPG specifically) to control [Torcs](https://sourceforge.net/projects/torcs/) (a car racing game) agent's movement. At each time step, car can move by steering, accelerating and braking.

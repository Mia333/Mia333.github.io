I am currently an senior AI researcher in Intelligent Computing research center at state key Lab [Zhejiang Lab](https://en.zhejianglab.com/), focusing on Reinforcement Learning and AutoML.

I obtained master in Electronic and Information Technology at [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/), Bachelor in [Automation](http://cse.zju.edu.cn/english/) at Zhejiang University. During my undergraduate, I was fortunate to conduct thesis research under supervision of [Prof. Dr. Patrick van der Smagt](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=5ybzvbsAAAAJ&hl=en), [Prof. Sami Haddadin](https://www.mirmi.tum.de/en/rsi/team/haddadin-sami/), [Dr. Alexandros Paraschos](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aCz_QHUAAAAJ), and [Dr. Nutan Chen](https://argmax.ai/team/nutan-chen/).

My wish is to build a fully automatic, robust system with learning-based methods in the challenging and complicated real-world. Particularly, I am keen to conduct research on the interdisciplinary area of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence. My interests in autonomous system deepened during my Internship in Bosch, about vision-based Perception with GAN technique in Stuttgart, for L5 autonomous driving Athena, a joint project of Robert Bosch GmbH and Daimler.

My research interest locates in the following area:

* Reinforcement Learning
* Robot Learning
* Perception
